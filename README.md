## jSon2Excel

In this File I'm going to explain <b>How to configure </b> and <b>Run this Framework</b>

The tech stack used for developing this framework are:
1. **JAVA** as the programming language for writing test code
2. **Maven** as the build tool
3. **Intellij** as the preferred IDE for writing java code.


#### Getting Started
Setup your machine.
1. Install JDK 11 & set "JAVA_HOME" in environment variable
2. Install Intellij
3. Download and Set "Maven_Home" as a environment variable
4. Add dependency - org.json to the POM.xml

#### Running tests
``Note:`` Sometime JRE System Library might be referring the wrong Library, please do select the JDK path in Build Path ```
1. You can run the tests directly from the intellij, by right-clicking POM.xml and **maven test**.
2. Framework will executes on Both Mac & Win [Make sure the above mentioned tools are installed and configured].
3. For Mac:
		-> Open the terminal
		-> Navigate to Project [project] Folder{root} directory 
		-> Execute the below command 
		```mvn clean install```
4. For Windows: 
		-> Open the command prompt
		-> Navigate to Project [project] Folder{root} directory 
		-> Execute the below command
		```mvn clean install```
